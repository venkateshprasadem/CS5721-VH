CS5721 - Vaccine Hub

Overview

With Vaccine Hub, customers can search for and book vaccine products (COVID vaccine) at centers / hospitals. Users can access the platform in two ways - as customers or as administrators. Administrators can add or update products, centers, and inventory. Customers can also be created and viewed by administrators. The customer can register, book an appointment at any center for any day within the next 7 days, and cancel it before the appointment date. After the first dosage is successful, customers can book the next dosage. Vaccine Administrators will be able to vaccinate the customers at their homes, with the customer able to choose between the two options.

Business scenario

Especially after a pandemic when the government vaccination programmes will become less frequent, we need to deliver a system that allows customers to search for and order covid vaccines. Based on centers and stocks, the system checks the available vaccines in the database and provides the results to the customer. We also have agents who manage and redistribute the stock. Certificates are also generated the next day after the appointment date and sent to the customers.
